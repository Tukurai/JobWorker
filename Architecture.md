# Worker Service
The worker service is a collection of microservices that are responsible for processing data and performing tasks in the background. It is designed to be scalable, resilient, and efficient.

# Architecture Overview
The worker service architecture consists of the following components:
1. **Worker.API** Responsible for interacting with the worker service and providing an API for external clients.
2. **Worker.Core** Contains the core business logic and domain models of the worker service.
3. **Worker.Infrastructure** Responsible for data access and persistence, including database interactions.
4. **Worker.Queue** Manages the queue for job processing, ensuring that jobs are executed efficiently. Possibly distributed across multiple instances.
5. **Worker.Scheduler** Responsible for executing scheduled jobs and managing the timing of job execution.
